# Next.js Tailwind Starter with Query

This is a minimal Next.js starter project with Tailwind CSS and query set up, so you can easily get started with your own custom project. The setup is simple and straightforward, allowing you to focus on building your application the way you like.

## Features

- Next.js framework for building React applications
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Basic query setup for fetching data

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>= 12.0.0)
- pnpm (>= 6.0.0)

If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally using the following command:

### `npm install -g pnpm`

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

#### `https://github.com/Myszczyson/barebone_next_tailwind_query.git`

2. Change to the project directory:

#### `cd barebone_next_tailwind_query`

3. Install dependencies:

#### `pnpm install`

4. Start the development server:

#### `pnpm run dev`

5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Customizing the Project

Now that you have the project set up, you can start customizing it to suit your needs. Edit the `pages/index.js` file to add your own components and modify the `styles/tailwind.css` file to add your custom Tailwind CSS styles.

To add new pages, simply create a new `.js` or `.tsx` file inside the `pages` directory.

For fetching data, React Query is set up as a provider, allowing you to use your preferred method of implementation.
